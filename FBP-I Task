The Most Interesting Thing I Learned About Money and Finance This Week

This week, I spent time exploring the fundamentals of money and finance, and one concept stood out to me the most—the time value of money (TVM). This principle, which I learned from Khan Academy’s “Introduction to Finance and Capital Markets,” states that money today is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its earning potential. This idea is at the core of investing, saving, and even everyday financial decisions. The more I thought about it, the more I realized how much TVM impacts both my personal finances and the broader economy in 2025.

Why the Time Value of Money Matters

At first, the concept of TVM seemed simple. If I had $100 today, I could invest it and earn interest, making it grow over time. But after watching Khan Academy’s videos on interest and debt, I realized how much this applies to real-life decisions. For example, when people take out loans, banks charge interest because they recognize that money today is more valuable than money repaid years later. Similarly, when individuals invest, they expect their money to grow over time, rewarding them for delaying consumption.

The idea also connects to banking and credit, as explained in Kurzgesagt’s “Banking Explained - Money and Credit.” Banks use deposits from savers to lend money to borrowers, and in doing so, they create more money in the system. This cycle keeps the economy moving, but it also makes understanding interest rates and inflation critical. If inflation is high, the money I hold today will lose value over time, which means I should invest wisely rather than let cash sit idle.

Applying TVM to My Life in 2025

Looking ahead to 2025, the time value of money will be more relevant than ever. With rising inflation and increasing digitization of finance, understanding how money grows will be crucial for making smart financial decisions. For instance:

1. Investing Early – After learning about TVM, I realize that the earlier I start investing, the better. Even small amounts invested today can grow significantly over time thanks to compound interest.
2. Avoiding High-Interest Debt – Loans and credit cards come with interest, which means borrowing money now can cost much more in the future. Being mindful of interest rates can help me avoid unnecessary debt.
3. Digital Currencies & Finance – As TED-Ed’s “The History of Money” video explained, money has evolved from barter to digital currencies. In 2025, with the rise of cryptocurrency and fintech, TVM will be even more important as new financial tools change how people save and invest.

Conclusion

The time value of money isn’t just a theoretical concept—it’s something that affects everyday financial choices. Learning about it this week made me realize the importance of investing early, managing debt wisely, and staying informed about financial trends. As we move further into 2025, having a strong understanding of TVM will help me, and many others, make smarter financial decisions in a rapidly changing world.
